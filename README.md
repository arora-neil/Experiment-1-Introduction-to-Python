# AIM: INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
# Theory:
math is the Python's built-in standard library module that provides essential mathematical functions and constants. It is included with Python and does not require a separate installation. It includes functions for number theory (factorial, gcd), power and logarithms (pow, sqrt, log), trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), and angular conversion (radians, degrees). It provides constants such as math.pi, math.e (Euler's number), and math.inf (infinity).
Limitation to this function is that it is  designed for use with real numbers only, for complex numbers, the cmath module is used instead.

The if...else statement in Python is a fundamental conditional statement used for decision-making. It allows a program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to True or False. 

# Algorithm:
  Mini Calculator-
  1.input two numbers a and b
  2.add=a+b, sub=a-b, mul=a*b, div=a/b, exp= a**b
  3. print the result.

  Area of Circle-
  1.import math library.
  2.calculate area=math.pi*r*r
  3.print result

  If else-
